This document summarizes the steps taken to integrate a WattProf plugin and test it.
1 - Develop the pwr_wpdev.c which is the plugin source code. The most important function is
the pwr_pidev_read that reads channel data. 

2 - Once the plugin functions are implemented, we need to integrate the plugin into the package. This is done through adding the required information into configure.ac file, as well as Makefile.am in the src/plugins folder. 

3 - Need to add file config/pwrapi_wattprof.m4 that specifies library and other dependency information.

4 - Now make using the following to test the above extensions:
 $ autogen.sh 
 $ configure --with-wattprof=<wattprof-library-installation-folder> --prefix=<installation folder - /usr/local is the default>
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


5 - Also need to test the WattProf plugin using the PowerAPI examples. Here we use snippet.c example. First need to add a sample system configuration XML file. We created examples/config/wp-node.xml.

6 - We may modify snippet.c if needed. In fact, we needed to add Pwr_DestroyCntx to this file. Then recompile.

7 - The examples/scripts folder is where executable scripts live. Those scripts set environment variables and execute example programs. We created run-snippet-wp.sh in that folder to run the snippet example with the WattProf (wp) plugin. 

8 - Note that we need to include PowerAPI installation folder in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. After this, need to copy a WattProf board configuration file (.rnp) under the name dev0_conf.rnp in the 
examples/scripts folder. This file will be used by the WattProf plugin to configure the board.
